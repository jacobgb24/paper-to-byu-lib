Super simple cross-browser extension for students/faculty at BYU to easily access academic papers.

When extension icon is clicked, the current URL is converted to a new URL that goes through the BYU library, allowing authentication through CAS.

This will lead to a 404 if the site is not supported by the library.

Tested on Firefox and Chrome so far.
